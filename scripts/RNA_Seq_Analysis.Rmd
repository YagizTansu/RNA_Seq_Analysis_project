# 2. Data Processing and Quality Control

## 2.1 Initial Setup

This section establishes the computational environment and loads necessary tools for analysis.


- **edgeR**: The core tool for differential gene expression analysis, providing robust statistical methods for comparing gene expression between different conditions and performing data normalization using the TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) method.

- **ggplot2**: Serves as the primary graphics engine, enabling the creation of publication-quality plots including volcano plots, PCA plots, and expression heatmaps.

- **RColorBrewer**: Complements ggplot2 by providing carefully designed color palettes that are both aesthetically pleasing and scientifically appropriate for different types of data visualization.

- **tidyverse**: A collection of packages that handles data manipulation and transformation tasks, including dplyr for data filtering and summarization, and tidyr for reshaping data structures.

- **stringr**: Provides essential string processing capabilities needed for gene name manipulation and text formatting throughout the analysis pipeline.

```{r libraries}
# Load required libraries
library(edgeR)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

# Create results directory if it doesn't exist
dir.create("../results", showWarnings = TRUE)
```

## 2.2 Data Import and Preprocessing

Here we load the raw data and perform initial quality checks to ensure data integrity.

### Load Data
```{r load_data}
# Read metadata and counts
metadata <- read.csv("../data/Metadata2025.csv", sep="\t", header=TRUE, check.names = FALSE,row.names=1)
counts <- read.csv("../data/Counts2025.csv", sep="\t", header=TRUE, check.names = FALSE, row.names=1)
```

### Control Data
```{r control_data}
head(counts) # Display first few rows of counts
dim(counts) # Expected dimensions: 28391 genes x 18 samples
apply(counts,2,sum) # Check total counts per sample
sum(is.na(counts))  # Check for missing values
head(metadata) # Display first few rows of metadata
dim(metadata) # Expected dimensions: 18 samples x 3 metadata columns
sum(is.na(metadata))  # Check for missing values
```

###
```{r add_sample_column_to_metadata}
metadata$Sample <- paste(metadata$Tissue, metadata$Donor, sep="_") # merge Tissue	Donor columns

# Ensure metadata has the same order as counts
metadata <- metadata[match(colnames(counts), metadata$Sample), ]

rownames(metadata) <- NULL # Reset row names to avoid confusion

# Check if the order matches
if (!all(metadata$Sample == colnames(counts))) {
    stop("Metadata sample names do not match count matrix columns.") # nolint
}

# Display updated metadata
head(metadata)

```


### Create a DGEList object for edgeR analysis
This step creates the fundamental data structure for edgeR analysis by:
Combines count data and metadata into a single object
Ensures data consistency and integrity

```{r create_dge}
dge <- DGEList(counts=counts, samples=metadata) # Create DGEList object)
head(dge$counts) # Count matrix (28,391 genes × 18 samples)
head(dge$samples) # Metadata information
head(dge$genes)  #Gene information (if available)
```



## 2.3 Filtering and Normalization

We apply standard RNA-Seq filtering criteria and normalization to prepare data for downstream analysis.

```{r filtering}
# Filter low expressed genes
keep <- rowSums(dge$counts > 10) >= 1
dge <- dge[keep, , keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]
print("Dimensions after filtering:")
dim(dge)

# Normalize the data
dge <- calcNormFactors(dge)
```

# 3. Expression Pattern Analysis

## 3.1 Individual Expression Profiles

This section examines gene expression patterns specific to individual donors.

```{r expression_patterns}
# Calculate CPM values
cpm_values <- cpm(dge, log=FALSE)

# Calculate donor averages
donor_averages <- list()
for (donor in unique(metadata$Donor)) {
    donor_samples <- metadata$Donor == donor
    donor_averages[[donor]] <- rowMeans(cpm_values[, donor_samples], na.rm = TRUE)
}

# Convert to data frame
avg_expr <- data.frame(
    S7 = donor_averages$S7,
    S12 = donor_averages$S12,
    S13 = donor_averages$S13
)
rownames(avg_expr) <- rownames(cpm_values)

# Classify genes
classify_expression <- function(row) {
    max_expr <- max(row)
    others <- row[row != max_expr]
    avg_others <- mean(others)
    
    if (max_expr >= 4 * max(others)) {
        return("individual_specific")
    } else if (max_expr >= 2 * avg_others) {
        return("individual_elevated")
    } else {
        return("not_elevated")
    }
}

expression_classes <- apply(avg_expr, 1, classify_expression)

# Create summary plot
ggplot(data.frame(Class = expression_classes)) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = Class, fill = Class)) +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Expression Patterns")
```

**Key Observations:**

\- The majority of genes fall into the "not_elevated" category, suggesting stable expression across individuals.

\- Individual-specific genes are the rarest, indicating strong genetic conservation.

\- Individual-elevated genes represent intermediate variability.

**Critical Analysis:**

\- The 4x and 2x thresholds are somewhat arbitrary and may need biological validation.

\- Individual variations could be confounded by tissue-specific effects.

\- Consider using more sophisticated statistical methods for classification.

# 4. Dimensional Reduction Analysis

## 4.1 Principal Component Analysis

PCA reveals major sources of variation in the gene expression data.

```{r pca_analysis}
# PCA Plot
logcpm <- cpm(dge, log=TRUE)
pca <- prcomp(t(logcpm))
pca_data <- data.frame(
    PC1 = pca$x[,1],
    PC2 = pca$x[,2],
    Tissue = metadata$Tissue,
    Donor = metadata$Donor
)

pca_plot <- ggplot(pca_data, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, color=Tissue, label=Donor)) +
    geom_point(size=3) +
    geom_text(hjust=0.5, vjust=-0.5) +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle("PCA Plot by Tissue")
print(pca_plot)
```

**Key Observations:**

\- PC1 clearly separates samples by tissue type, explaining the largest variance.

\- PC2 shows some donor-specific clustering.

\- Tissue differences dominate over individual variations

**Critical Analysis:**

\- Consider the impact of normalization on the separation.

\- Batch effects might influence clustering.

\- Additional PCs might reveal other important patterns.

## 4.2 Multi-dimensional Scaling

MDS provides an alternative view of sample relationships based on expression distances.

```{r mds_analysis}
# MDS Plot
mds <- plotMDS(dge, plot=FALSE)
mds_data <- data.frame(
    Dim1 = mds$x,
    Dim2 = mds$y,
    Tissue = metadata$Tissue,
    Donor = metadata$Donor
)

mds_plot <- ggplot(mds_data, aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, color=Tissue, label=Donor)) +
    geom_point(size=3) +
    geom_text(hjust=0.5, vjust=-0.5) +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle("MDS Plot by Tissue")
print(mds_plot)
```

**Key Observations:**

\- MDS confirms the tissue-specific clustering seen in PCA.

\- Shows biological distance between samples based on leading fold changes.

\- Individual donors show consistent patterns within tissues.

**Critical Analysis:**

\- Compare with PCA results to validate patterns.

\- Consider impact of outliers on the scaling.

\- May need additional dimensions for complete pattern detection.

# 5. Differential Expression Analysis

## 5.1 Tissue-Specific Expression

This analysis identifies genes that show significant expression differences between liver and brain tissues.

```{r differential_expression}
# Setup comparison
selected_tissues <- c("liver", "brain")
selected_samples <- dge$samples$Tissue %in% selected_tissues
dge_selected <- dge[, selected_samples]
dge_selected$samples$group <- factor(dge_selected$samples$Tissue)

# Estimate dispersion
dge_selected <- estimateCommonDisp(dge_selected)
dge_selected <- estimateTagwiseDisp(dge_selected)

# Test for DE
et <- exactTest(dge_selected, pair=c("liver", "brain"))
top_genes <- topTags(et, n=Inf)
sig_genes <- top_genes$table[top_genes$table$FDR < 0.05,]

# Create volcano plot
ggplot(top_genes$table, aes(x=logFC, y=-log10(FDR))) +
    geom_point(aes(color=FDR < 0.05), size=1) +
    scale_color_manual(values=c("grey", "red")) +
    theme_bw() +
    ggtitle("Volcano Plot: Liver vs Brain")
```

**Key Observations:**

\- Clear separation between significant and non-significant genes.

\- Symmetrical distribution suggests unbiased analysis.

\- Strong tissue-specific expression patterns.

**Critical Analysis:**

\- Consider alternative FDR thresholds.

\- High-fold-change genes might need validation.

\- Technical variation could affect extreme values.

# 6. Gene Classification Analysis

## 6.1 Expression Categories

We classify genes based on their expression patterns and regulatory behavior.

```{r gene_classes}
# Classify genes into categories
gene_classes <- data.frame(top_genes$table) %>%
  mutate(class = case_when(
    FDR <= 0.01 & logFC > 0 ~ "DE_UP",
    FDR <= 0.01 & logFC < 0 ~ "DE_DOWN",
    FDR > 0.01 & logFC > 0 ~ "notDE_UP",
    FDR > 0.01 & logFC < 0 ~ "notDE_DOWN"
  ))

gene_classes$class <- factor(gene_classes$class, 
                           levels = c("DE_UP", "DE_DOWN", "notDE_UP", "notDE_DOWN"))

# Create boxplot
ggplot(gene_classes, aes(x=class, y=logFC, fill=class)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set2") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of logFC by Gene Class") +
  xlab("Gene Class") +
  ylab("Log2 Fold Change") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

**Key Observations:**

\- Clear separation between up/down-regulated genes.

\- Non-DE genes show expected symmetrical distribution.

\- DE genes show substantial fold changes.

**Critical Analysis:**

\- Consider effect size distributions.

\- Evaluate biological significance thresholds.

\- May need tissue-specific reference ranges.

# 7. Integration Analysis

## 7.1 DEG and Individual Pattern Overlap

This section explores the relationship between tissue-specific and individual-specific expression patterns.

```{r deg_overlap}
# Analyze overlap between DEGs and individual patterns
deg_genes <- rownames(sig_genes)
individual_specific_genes <- names(expression_classes)[expression_classes == "individual_specific"]
individual_elevated_genes <- names(expression_classes)[expression_classes == "individual_elevated"]

deg_specific_overlap <- intersect(deg_genes, individual_specific_genes)
deg_elevated_overlap <- intersect(deg_genes, individual_elevated_genes)

deg_individual_summary <- data.frame(
    Category = c("Individual-specific DEGs", "Individual-elevated DEGs"),
    Count = c(length(deg_specific_overlap), length(deg_elevated_overlap)),
    Percentage_of_DEGs = c(
        length(deg_specific_overlap) / length(deg_genes) * 100,
        length(deg_elevated_overlap) / length(deg_genes) * 100
    )
)
