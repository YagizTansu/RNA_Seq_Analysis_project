Gene Class Boxplot Description:
 Distribution of log2 fold changes across different gene categories:
 - DE_UP: Significantly upregulated genes (FDR ≤ 0.01)
 - DE_DOWN: Significantly downregulated genes (FDR ≤ 0.01)
 - notDE_UP: Non-significant genes with positive log fold change
 - notDE_DOWN: Non-significant genes with negative log fold change
